  # version :thumb do
  #   process :scale => [50, 50]

  # Add a white list of extensions which are allowed to be uploaded.
  # For images you might use something like this:
  # def extension_white_list
  %w(pdf doc docx txt jpg png)

  # Avoid using model.id or version_name here, see uploader/store.rb for details.
